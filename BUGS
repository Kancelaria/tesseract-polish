- There are semantical mistakes in the example texts (e.g. arithmetic formula 
in the bootstrap part0 sample). I know, I was quite tired when writing those 
and when I've noticed them it was too late into the process to redo them. The 
Tesseract training guide advises to make the sample text realistic, but not 
THAT realistic :)
